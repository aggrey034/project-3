    "**INTRODUCTION**\n",
    "\n",
    "SyriaTel, like many telecommunications companies, faces the challenge of customers stop using their services because of one reason or another. This not only leads to a direct loss in revenue but also incurs additional costs related to acquiring new customers to replace those who have left through advertsing and marketing. The goal of this project is to predicts whether a customer is likely to stop doing business with SyriaTel in the near future. By identifying patterns and factors that contribute to customer stop using their services, the company can take proactive measures to retain at-risk customers and at the same same time gain new ones.\n",
    "Ultimately, this project should help SyriaTel not only retain more customers but also optimize its marketing and customer service efforts, leading to improved customer satisfaction and sustained revenue growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "**PROBLEM STATEMENT**\n",
    "\n",
    "SyriaTel faces significant revenue losses when customers discontinue their services. To address this, we need to develop a binary classification model to predict whether a customer is likely to stop using SyriaTelâ€™s services soon. By analyzing customer data, such as usage patterns and service interactions, this model will identify at-risk customers. Understanding these predictive patterns will allow SyriaTel to implement targeted retention strategies, reducing churn and associated revenue loss. This approach aims to enhance customer retention and improve overall financial performance.\n",
