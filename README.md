# **NAME**;   Aggrey Musonye Timbwa

# **DATA BEING ANALYSING**;  SyriaTel Customer Churn

# **PROJECT PERIOD**; 22/08/2024 to 30/08/2024

# **STUDENT PACE**; part_time classes

# **INTRODUCTION**

SyriaTel, like many telecommunications companies, faces the challenge of customers stop using their services because of one reason or another. This not only leads to a direct loss in revenue but also incurs additional costs related to acquiring new customers to replace those who have left through advertsing and marketing. The goal of this project is to predicts whether a customer is likely to stop doing business with SyriaTel in the near future. By identifying patterns and factors that contribute to customer stop using their services, the company can take proactive measures to retain at-risk customers and at the same same time gain new ones.
Ultimately, this project should help SyriaTel not only retain more customers but also optimize its marketing and customer service efforts, leading to improved customer satisfaction and sustained revenue growth.

# **PROBLEM STATEMENT**

SyriaTel faces significant revenue losses when customers discontinue their services. To address this, we need to develop a binary classification model to predict whether a customer is likely to stop using SyriaTelâ€™s services soon. By analyzing customer data, such as usage patterns and service interactions, this model will identify at-risk customers. Understanding these predictive patterns will allow SyriaTel to implement targeted retention strategies, reducing churn and associated revenue loss. This approach aims to enhance customer retention and improve overall financial performance.

# **OBJECTIVES**

1. To develop a predictive model
2. understand the key features in the data set
3. Evaluate the model
4. Aid in decision making 


# **DATA DESCRIPTION**

The data set is named sim_usage.csv and contains the following sections; 
1. state 
2. account length
3.  area code 
4. phone number
5. international plan 
6. voice mail plan 
7. number vmail messages
8. total day minutes 
9. total day calls 
10. total day charge
11. total eve minutes
12. total eve calls 
13. total eve charge 
14. total night minutes 
15. total night calls 
16. total night charge 
17. total intl minutes 
18. total intl calls 
19. total intl charge 
20. customer service calls 
21. churn 



# **METHODOLOGY**

This project will follow the following steps
1. Data understanding ; reading the data and inspecting it
2. Data preparation; involves cleaning and handling outlier
3. Modelling; bulding predictive models
4. Evaluation ; assesing the model performance

# **Tools and Libraries Used**

The project utilizes a range of tools and libraries for data analysis and machine learning. Here are the key technologies used:

Data Analysis and Manipulation Tools and libraries:

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Scikit-learn

# **Conclusion and Recommendations**

It is not easily predictable if someone will churn or not from the given set of data
However, factors such as total day minutes, total day charge and total eve charge likely influence the ability of one to stop using the service provider.
